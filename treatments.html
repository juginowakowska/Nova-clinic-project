            <p>
                Botox and dermal filler treatments are popular, accounting for more than 9 million procedures in 2015, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).

                Botox contains purified bacteria that freeze muscles. In doing so, Botox can help minimize the appearance of lines and wrinkles caused by facial expressions.
                
                Dermal fillers contain ingredients that add fullness to areas that have thinned due to aging. This thinning is common in the cheeks, lips, and around the mouth.

            <p>
                Carboxytherapy is a non-surgical cosmetic medicine treatment for dermatology. Carboxytherapy employs injections or transdermal application to infuse gaseous carbon dioxide below the skin into the subcutaneous tissue through a needle or skin.
                Carboxytherapy involves injecting carbon dioxide under the surface of the skin with a fine needle.On average, patients enjoy the results of Carboxytherapy for 5-6 months, but your individual results will depend entirely on you. After your initial sessions, twice yearly treatments can help you maintain your results.

What is the lowest common denominator of heavy legs, swollen ankles, swollen eyelids? Often, a non-ideal lymphatic circulation: if lymph stagnates in the tissues and is not drained, it accumulates, creating swelling and circulatory difficulties, even to the point of causing the appearance of cellulite. On the other hand, when the tissues are well drained, legs are light, there is no water stagnation and skin looks brighter and more compact.
