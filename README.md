## Introduction
The goal of this website is to showcase a new (fictional) Aesthetic Clinic in Mnchester, UK. The clinic's webiste was created as the first part of the five Milestone projects required to obtain the Diploma in Full Stack Software development program at The Code Institute.

The inspiration for this site came from the fast growing trend of non-invasive beauty procedures in the UK area. The site focuses on representiving various treatments and serves as an introdution for new comers of various possibilities of aesthetic medicine. The site has commercial purpose.

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

### Development-Planes
For the site to fuction as intended and fullfill its purpose for the user, the developer needs to develop all aspects of a fictinal healthcare facility. This includes the tratmnet description, enquiry page, team photo, clinics address and contact details so that the user can successfuly go through a patient journey from start to finish.

#### Strategy
Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:
- **Roles:**
    - Current Users 
    - Potential Patient
    - Returning Patient
    - Person with interest in aesthetic medicine

- **Demographic:**

    - Interested in receiving a treatment

- **Psychographic:**
    - Middle to upper-class

The website needs to enable the **user** to:
- Retrive the desired information:
    - Treatment guide and description
    - Preparation required for the appointment 
    - Medical opinion
    - Recommended treatment for personal circumstances
    - Clinic's address and contact details
    
The website needs to enable the **site manager** to:

#### Scope
The scope plane is about defining requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. Using the information in the strategy plane, the identified required features have been broken into the following two categories.
- Content Requirements:
    - The user will be looking for:
        - Available tretamnts list and description
        - Tips on what treatment is best
        - Gallery to vie the results
        - Social Media links to confirm credibility of teh business
        - Reviews

    - The user will be able to:
        - Contact the clinic to book an appoitment 
        - Be able to easily navigate the site to find the information they require

#### Structure
The information above were organized in a hierarchical tree structure, showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:

</details>

### Skeleton 
Wireframes were made to showcase the appearance of the site pages while keeping a positive user experience in mind. The wireframes were created using a desktop version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
-------------


### Design
#### Colour Scheme 
I have chosen my colour scheme by using [SheCodes](https://palettes.shecodes.io/) colour scheme palette based on bright pink (#f95959)contrast colour, which represents femininity and sensitivity whioch the clinic represents.

This is complemented by a dark blue (#233142), lighter blue (#455d7a), whitesmoke (#f5f5f5) and grey (#e3e3e3).
The grey shade (#e3e3e3) was used with .6 opacity to create a text overlay box on top of the hero picture on the main page.
Main content text is a dark blue (#233142) shade, as this colour creates the best contrast between other colours on the page, to gurantee the clean look of the website and high readibility of the text. The background palette includes some soft shades to make it easier to read for visually impaired individuals.

#### Typography
The typography pairing used on this site are [Aboreto, cursive](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aboreto?query=aboreto) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppin). A backup of Sans-Serif had been applied in case of an error.

Aboreto was used for the title,headings and contact information; Poppins was used for standard text.

#### Imagery
The selected imagery has been sourced from various sites. Some pieces, like the Review section or logo in the tab bar, were created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

## Issues and Bugs
The developer run into a number of issues during the development of this site. The most interesting ones have been described below, thid includes the fix for the bug.

**Logo Bug** - A bug was detected whist trying to embed a logo for the page in the browser tab. The logo was uploaded using a [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/ "Favicon Generator") with their instructions but unfortunately did not dipslayed as expected. It turns out the link available on favicon was incorrect and eventually through trial and error the developer connected the right folders to the HTML header section. However, the logo was still not visible at times.To make sure the icon is visible every time the page is opened, the server was stoppped and restarted, the page was reloaded and cache removed from the browser with the help of my mentor Owonikoko Oluwaseun.This managed to rectify the issue permanently.
**Home Page Image Bug** - A bug was detected by the developer upon uploading images and text content to the main page. Due to the screen being split into two dolumns using sections and divs the developer was unable to align a large image within a designated space. The image kept cominhg up cropped or too big for the container. After a search online and converstaion with mentor, the developer decided to utilise a flex-container and therefore devided the space into two, equal columns with a help of Boostrap. This had rectify the issue and the developer successfully incorporated text and images into the project's main home page.
**Contact Form Bug** - Upon creating the Contact Form the developer realised that there is not eanough space between the input fields and the text above it, as well as the input fields itself are not big enough. This created a cramped space within the form and would negatively impact the user experience. The developer has used various sites used by codes, like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb "Slack")and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow"), to find different ways to fix this issue. The developer then created a css rule for input items by type (email,text.tel) and increased margin and padding. Thsi created the desired space and resolved the problem.
